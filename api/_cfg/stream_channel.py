    # running with zero subscribers, so an unbounded buffer here grows for the
    # WHOLE turn (a busy turn emits thousands of coalesced token frames) — an OOM
    # risk per abandoned turn (#4633). Bounding to the most recent N frames keeps
    # a reconnecting tab's needed *tail* intact; older dropped frames stay
    # recoverable via the run journal by last_event_id. 8192 is generous enough
    # to hold a long multi-tool turn's backlog while capping worst-case memory to
    # a fixed number of small (event, data, id) tuples — deliberately far above
    # the per-subscriber queue cap below (that queue drops on a *slow* reader;
    # this buffer must survive a legitimate reconnect gap).

    # Per-subscriber queue cap (drop-oldest on full). Each connected tab gets its
    # own queue; a slow/backpressured or backgrounded tab used to hold an
    # UNBOUNDED queue.Queue that grew for the WHOLE turn (the producer is the
    # agent token stream), an OOM risk with many tabs × long agentic turns. This
    # caps the per-tab live-broadcast growth to a fixed bound.
    #
    # Bound is intentionally EQUAL to _OFFLINE_BUFFER_MAXLEN, not the much
    # smaller SessionChannel per-subscriber cap of 16. StreamChannel carries the
    # live chat token stream (thousands of frames per turn) and, unlike
    # SessionChannel's low-frequency UI pings, has a reconnect-replay contract:
    # a tab that briefly disconnected must receive the full retained offline
    # tail on resubscribe. Capping below the offline buffer would truncate that
    # replay and force every flaky-network reconnect through the run journal
    # (disk reads) instead of the in-memory fast path. Matching the offline
    # buffer bound preserves that contract while bounding live-broadcast memory
    # to the SAME worst-case #4633 already accepted (a fixed number of small
    # (event, data, id) tuples). The SSE write deadline
    # (SSE_WRITE_DEADLINE_SECONDS) independently breaks a stuck socket within
    # ~20s, so the overflow window is short; this cap bounds it by frame count
    # too. Older frames stay recoverable via the run journal by last_event_id.
